## 📂 Repository Structure

### **AI for Nano PKPD**
- df_ML.csv: the used data for ML/AI development.
- AI_for_Nano_PKPD.ipynb: ML/AI model code for the investigation of Nano PK-PD relationship, including data preprocessinng, ML/AI development, hyperparmeter tuning, and feature importance analysis. 

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Comprehensive features** Nanoparticles' physicochemial properties, experimental strategies, administration regimens were collected from the published papers. 

- **Exploration of PK-PD relationship** To establish the PK/PD relationship, the PK metrics were predicted by the AI-assisted PBPK model, informing ML model development. 

- **Interpretation** SHAP analysis was applied to explain the feature importance on model predictions.
